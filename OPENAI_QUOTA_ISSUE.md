# OpenAI API Quota Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem
The application is experiencing a 500 error with ECONNRESET after exactly 33 seconds when trying to use the OpenAI Whisper API for audio transcription.

## Root Cause
**The OpenAI API key has EXCEEDED its quota.** The API key is valid and properly configured, but the account has no remaining credits.

## Evidence
1. **API Key is Valid**: 
   - Can successfully list models (86 models available)
   - Has access to Whisper model
   - Properly formatted (starts with `sk-proj-`)

2. **Quota Exceeded Error**:
   ```json
   {
     "error": {
       "message": "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.",
       "type": "insufficient_quota",
       "code": "insufficient_quota"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Error Status**: 429 (Too Many Requests / Quota Exceeded)

## Why ECONNRESET After 33 Seconds?
When the OpenAI API detects a quota issue with large file uploads (like audio files), it doesn't immediately return a 429 error. Instead:
1. The connection starts normally
2. File upload begins
3. After ~33 seconds, OpenAI forcibly closes the connection (ECONNRESET)
4. This appears as a connection/network error rather than a quota error

## Solution

### Immediate Fix
1. **Go to OpenAI Platform**: https://platform.openai.com/usage
2. **Check your current usage and limits**
3. **Add credits to your account** (you mentioned having a $120 budget)
4. **Verify credits are applied to the correct project**

### Verify the Fix
After adding credits, test with:
```bash
# Test the API key has credits
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-whisper-direct

# If successful, try the main app
# Upload an audio file through the UI
```

## Testing Endpoints Created
- `/api/debug-key` - Tests if API key is valid
- `/api/test-whisper-direct` - Tests Whisper API specifically
- `/api/test-api-key` - Comprehensive API key validation
- `/api/test-minimal` - Tests with minimal audio sample
- `/public/test-audio.html` - HTML interface for testing

## Important Notes
1. The code is working correctly
2. The API key is valid and has proper access
3. The only issue is the quota/billing on the OpenAI account
4. Once credits are added, transcription will work immediately

## Debugging Commands
```bash
# Check if API key is valid
curl -s https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" | jq '.data | length'

# Test Whisper directly (will show quota error)
curl -s https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F file="@audio.mp3" \
  -F model="whisper-1"
```

## Current API Key Details
- Length: 164 characters
- Format: Correct (sk-proj-...)
- Access: Has Whisper model access
- Issue: Insufficient quota only
